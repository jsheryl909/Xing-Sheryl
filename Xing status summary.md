Week 4 - Xing

During Week 4, my responsibility was to integrate the cleaned MovieLens ratings dataset with the cleaned movie metadata Sheryl produced in Week 3. I have completed all of this work in a new Jupyter notebook called data_integration_week4.ipynb, which is stored in the main project folder, XING-SHERYL/, so that both of us can access it easily. Rather than re-running the entire cleaning process of Week 3, I loaded in the cleaned output files that Sheryl produced—ratings_clean.csv and movies_clean.csv—both of which are stored inside the IS 477 Project/ directory.

The verification at the outset of the integration process was done in regard to the structure of each dataset: the number of rows, the unique movieId values, and confirmation that the data types of key columns matched across the two sources. Once this was confirmed, I performed the core task of Week 4: the merge of MovieLens ratings with the movie metadata on the movieId column using an inner join. This join tied every user rating to its corresponding movie title, release year, and genre information. After the merge, I assessed how successful the merge was, checking the count of distinct movie IDs before and after integration. Additionally, I identified movie IDs present in the ratings yet without a match in the metadata, along with movies in the metadata which had never been rated. Documenting such mismatches serves to explain why some records may not appear in the merged dataset. After completing the integrated dataset, I wrote the output into a new file named ratings_with_metadata.csv. It is housed inside the IS 477 Project/ folder. This now acts as the combined source across all exploratory analysis and visualizations for Week 5. As in Week 3, Week 4 has its own dedicated notebook, data_integration_week4.ipynb, so that every phase of the project is clearly separated. This structure-a single .ipynb file per week-keeps the workflow organized, making it easy for either of us to review, update, or troubleshoot any part of this process as the project continues.

Week 5 - Collaboration both Sheryl and Xing

During Week 5, the two of us proceeded to explore the data using the integrated dataset from Week 4. All that work is done in a new notebook called exploratory_analysis_week5.ipynb saved in the main XING-SHERYL project directory. We started by loading the merged dataset called ratings_with_metadata.csv from the IS 477 Project folder, which included user ratings along with each movie's title, genres, and release year. By starting with this combined data set, we were able to focus immediately on analysis without having to repeat any cleaning or merging steps.

The first part of our analysis covered the overall distribution of user ratings by visualizing a histogram of rating values. This provided us insight into how MovieLens users generally rated films. We then "exploded" movies with multiple genres and computed average ratings by genre to understand trends based on genre. That gave us an idea as to which types of movies generally get higher ratings. We examined changes over time, plotting average ratings by release year to see long-term trends across decades. Finally, when possible, we analyzed runtime compared to rating to see whether movie length impacts audience scoring.

All visualizations were created within the Week 5 notebook, and summary tables of means by genre and year were written out as CSVs for quick reference later in the project. By the end of Week 5, we had developed a solid comprehension of the patterns of ratings along a number of key dimensions, which would form the basis for higher-order insights in the coming weeks.
