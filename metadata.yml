      This project combines the MovieLens ratings dataset with external movie metadata
      to explore how viewer ratings relate to attributes such as genre and release year.
      We clean and integrate the datasets, perform exploratory analysis, and implement
      a simple recommendation system that returns top-rated movies by genre and year.
      All code, notebooks, and derived outputs are organized to support reproducibility
      and transparency. Key output data files are stored in a shared Box folder and can
      be downloaded and placed into the project directory to reproduce our results.
